# botManager v2
I made this project for fun, it allows you to use a handful of commands on a bunch of alts!

# How to Use
- Install [Roblox Account Manager](https://github.com/ic3w0lf22/Roblox-Account-Manager)
- Create/Add an account you want to control the bots on
- Create/Add any amount of accounts with a certain prefix e.g "prefix12_name" "himynameis_name"
- Go into src.lua, and change the config info to match your accounts' info
- Join a game on the account you want to control the bots on **first** on the account manager
- Copy the Job ID `setclipboard(game.JobId)`
- Paste it into the Job ID field beside the Place ID field
- Join on all of your alts
- If you have done this correctly, you will now be able to use the commands on your alts! A list of commands can be found below.
